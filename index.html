    <h1>Free bass tabs that actually focus on the bass.</h1>
    <p>
      I made this site because a lot of “free tab” resources are really full-band transcriptions that
      gloss over what the bass is doing — the little movements, the feel, and the parts that make the groove work.
      Everything here is written specifically for bass and shared for free.
